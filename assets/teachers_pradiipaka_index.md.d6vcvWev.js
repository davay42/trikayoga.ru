He was born in Rosario but lives in Moscow.</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 58.</p><p><strong>Spiritual lineage:</strong> In 1983 (April) he received spontaneous initiation in the form of Śaktipāta (lit. &quot;descent of Power&quot;, i.e. divine Grace) by repeating the sacred mantra &quot;Om̐ namaḥ śivāya&quot; while he was watching a photo of Svāmī Muktānanda. Hence, despite Svāmī Muktānanda having passed away in 1982, Gabriel Pradīpaka considers him to be his Guru. A few months later (October, 1983), he was &quot;formally&quot; initiated by Svāmī Alakṣānanda, also belonging to the Muktānanda&#39;s spiritual lineage. As you surely know... or maybe not... Muktānanda is the Master who brought the Siddha Yoga path to the West. Gabriel Pradīpaka was learning/working in the well-known Siddha Yoga community till 1989. Since late 1989 through the end of 1991 and since late 1994 through the end of 1997, he was learning/teaching/working with another teacher (a disciple of the great Muktānanda too), who was crucial in his life as a yogī. And since 1997 he has been on his own.</p><p>He also recognizes Svāmī Lakṣmaṇa Joo as his Trika Guru.</p><p>In February of 2016, he founded the Parabhairavayoga, a brandnew spiritual movement that is just starting to spread around the world.</p><p>In short, he is a spiritual guru, conversant with Sanskrit language and Trika philosophy, who sheds light on spirituality as a whole and helps spiritual aspirants out with the process known as Self-realization or Final Liberation.</p><p><strong>Studies:</strong> Sanskrit, Trika (Non-dual Shaivism of Kashmir), Tantra, Patañjali&#39;s Yoga, Sāṅkhya, Vedānta, Vedic rituals, etc. Anyway, his specialty is Trika and Sanskrit. He has been learning/teaching Trika and Sanskrit in depth since 1989.</p></div><p><img src="'+s+'" alt=""><img src="'+r+'" alt=""><img src="'+n+'" alt=""><img src="'+o+'" alt=""><img src="'+p+'" alt=""><img src="'+h+'" alt=""><img src="'+d+'" alt=""><img src="'+c+'" alt=""><img src="'+l+'" alt=""><img src="'+g+'" alt=""><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p>',2),k=[u];function w(f,S,b,v,y,j){return e(),t("div",null,k)}const A=a(_,[["render",w]]);export{P as __pageData,A as default};
